Problem Statement:
Prepare a program that suggest the captions of input image to increase the instagram reach (without using any full/partial paid API).

Description: This project is a Python script that generates a caption and estimates the number of likes for an image, typically for social media platforms like Instagram. 
It utilizes the PIL (Python Imaging Library) to extract features from the image and then generates a caption and estimates likes based on certain criteria such as image dimensions and 
color palette diversity.

Breakdown Of Code:
Image Features Extraction (image_features function):

Opens the image using PIL and extracts its width, height, and color histogram.
Caption Generation (generate_caption function):

Constructs a caption using random adjectives, verbs, and objects.
The caption includes a description of the image and its dimensions, as well as information about its color palette.
Suggesting a Caption (suggest_caption function):

Combines the image features extraction and caption generation to suggest a caption for the provided image.
Estimating Likes (suggest_likes and estimate_likes functions):

Estimates the number of likes based on the image's dimensions and color palette diversity.
Likes are estimated based on criteria such as image resolution and the richness of the color palette.
Main Script Execution:

Defines the path to the image file.
Calls the suggest_caption function to generate a caption for the image.
Calls the suggest_likes function to estimate the number of likes for the image.
Prints the generated caption and estimated likes, shares, and saves for the image.


Overall, this script can be useful for automatically generating captions and estimating engagement metrics for images intended for social media posting. 
However, keep in mind that the accuracy of these estimations may vary depending on the specific context and audience preferences. 
Additionally, the script could be further enhanced by incorporating more sophisticated image analysis techniques and training on larger datasets for better caption generation 
and engagement estimation.
